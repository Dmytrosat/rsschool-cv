## About Me:
 I am 56 years old. I work as a construction engineer in construction. I design residential, public, and industrial buildings and structures. I became interested in  
 creating websites. That's why I chose this course. My goal is to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development.  I dream of becoming a specialist in web 
 development and design, whose task is to design user interfaces for websites or applications.Remote work as a designer in construction gives me additional free time, 
 which I spend on learning Frontend Development. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,

 new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
